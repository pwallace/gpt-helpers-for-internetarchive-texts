The "Connecting 350 and Study Abroad" document outlines a student project from Middlebury College in 2009 aiming to link study abroad programs with the global climate movement, particularly the goals of 350.org. The project involved collaboration with 350.org representatives and study abroad program coordinators to engage students in the International Day of Climate Action. It includes strategies like creating resources, presenting at conferences, conducting focus groups, and organizing pre-departure meetings to involve students in climate action during their study abroad experiences. The document reflects on successes and limitations, provides recommendations for future initiatives, and stresses the significance of cultural sensitivity and practical considerations in addressing global climate change. The project emphasizes technology and interpersonal connections, offering insights from focus groups conducted with returned study abroad and international students across various regions. It suggests ways to engage local communities abroad and highlights the importance of individual and collaborative efforts in combating climate change.
